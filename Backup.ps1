# Creating regular backups of important files.
# Preventing data loss in case of accidental deletion or system failure.

# set the source folder path
$source = "PATH"

# set Backup folder path
$backup = "D:\Backup-folder"

# check backup folder

    New-item -ItemType Directory -path $backup
}

#copy all files and subfolders from source to backup
